# Unreal Engine 4 save game converter specifically adapted for Railroads Online
This library and simple console tool for it will try to convert the Railroads Online UE4 save game file into a JSON for easier analysis.

Back convertion is theoretically possible, but is not implemented.

The simple convertor included will produce two JSON files in same folder where \*.sav file is.
One is more or less exact copy of data as they are saved in \*.sav file - named <sav_name>.orig.json
The other one is converted to more human readable form - called <sav_name>.better.json

#### *PLEASE NOTE, THAT THIS TOOL WAS MADE PURELY FOR FEATURES WHICH ARE YET TO BE DONE INGAME (E.G. FINDING LOST VEHICLES) AND ITS MAIN GOAL ISN'T ANY TYPE OF HACKING/BREAKING THE GAME!!!*
